# rock-paper-scissors
The self-guided rock paper scissors project exercise from the Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors)

The problem: to create a rock paper scissors game using javascript. The player will play against the computer, and results will be logged into the console (may be updated later to have a GUI)

Planning/Pseudocode:

1. Ask player to input their selection ("Rock" "Paper" or "Scissors), store their answer
2. Randomly determine the computer's choice between "Rock" "Paper" and "Scissors", store the selection
3. Evaluate the different possible combinations of player and computer choice
4. Determine whether player or computer has won depending on the combination

#1 - Make use of prompt(). Only accept answers that are "Rock" "Paper" or "Scissors", error if player enters invalid answer

#2 - Use math.Random and determine rock/paper/scissors depending on the number it lands on. 

#3 & #4 - Use if and else if statements in a function, and also && logical operator. Return the result to be console.log()'d
